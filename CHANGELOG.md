### 1.3.0
#### Features:
- Added support for [`dbt-core version 1.3.0`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/discussions/6011) and migrated testing framework to new testing framework according to DBT guidelines. 
- Support for incremental model strategy ‘Append’. 
- Support for incremental model strategy ‘insert_overwrite’.
- Support for multiple optimization parameters for table materialization:
  - order_by
  - segmented_by_string
  - segmented_by_all_nodes
  - no_segmentation
  - ksafe
  - partition_by_string
  - partition_by_group_by_string
  - partition_by_active_count
- Support for enabling privileges inheritance for tables/views using INCLUDE SCHEMA PRIVILEGES by default in model materialization. If not required, can be disabled using EXCLUDE in the Vertica Server.
- Defined profile_template which helps user to configure profile while creating the project.
- Support for Python 3.10.
#### Fixes:
- Incremental materialization refactoring and cleanup.
- Updates to correctly handle errors for multi-statement queries.
#### Breaking Changes
##### Change description:
- Refactored `merge_columns` config parameter to `unique_key`.
- Support for the `merge_update_columns` to only merge the columns specified.
##### Impact:
- For the incremental model strategy ‘delete+insert’ and ‘merge’, `unique_key` is now a required parameter and it fails if not provided. 
- Existing applications using config parameter `merge_columns` will give an error because `merge_columns` as been removed.
##### Workaround/Solution:
- When using the incremental model strategy ‘delete+insert’ and ‘merge’ pass the required parameter `unique_key` instead of `merge_columns` in config and `merge_update_columns` is used to only merge the columns specified.
